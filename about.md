Notes: 

Object-Oriented Programming:
-Organize your code though encapsulation
-Group together data and functions whitch are related.
-User defined type which is speific to an application. Example: ints have data (number, and functions +,-, etc.). Functions but no class (defines data and functions)

Objects in Go:
-Go uses structs with associated methods (not using term class)
-Can associate methods or functions with those structs

Concurrency in Go:
-Managing multiple tasks at the same time.
-Go includes Concurrency primmitaves
-`Goroutines` represent concurrent tasks
-`channels` are used to communicate between tasks
-`select` enables task synchronization

Packages
-First line of file names the package
-Pacakge called Main `main`, makes an executible
  -Needs a function `main()`
  -`main()` is where the code execution starts
